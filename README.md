# snake-experimenter [‚ö†Ô∏è DRAFT]

this repo is a lil experiment around creating a 'snake game' with various models.

test-prompt:
```
hello! can we kickoff with a new project that is a lightweight webapp game.
- game would follow the 'snake' pattern of avoiding objects (& self)
- eating things makes snake grow in length
- speed of movement increases
  
we want to be able to host this cheaply (local storage if anything, but i'll
want to share this game)
```

## initial experiment

0. initial idea-spark was triggered when i heard someone mention the snake_game + nokia phone.
1. opened up first tool (as of writing, it is usually `claude code` or `gemini` depending on context).
2. input less-than-ideal prompt to test (could have improved the initial prompt, but ü§∑)
3. viewed results of `claude code`
4. tried same experiment with `gemini`

### initial outputs
